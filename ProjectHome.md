### About the Book ###
ActiveMQ In Action is for software architects, developers, and integrators interested in enterprise message queuing in general and ActiveMQ in particular. This book is designed to serve as part introduction and part reference for both beginners and experienced application developers. It begins with an introduction to ActiveMQ and a high-level overview of JMS followed by a progressively deeper dive into ActiveMQ as the book advances.

The concepts discussed throughout this book assume that the reader possesses enough knowledge of Java EE to design and develop applications. Though such knowledge is not a strict requirement, it will make it easier to grasp many of the con- cepts touched upon throughout the chapters. Chapter 9 even discusses using ActiveMQ with languages other than Java, including C++, C#, Javascript, Perl, PHP, Python, and Ruby.
